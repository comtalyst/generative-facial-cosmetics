# Generative Facial Cosmetics
Our task is to apply various facial makeup products to the input face automatically and smoothly. Instead of placing the predefined layer of makeup on top of the face image, we are going to approach this task by regenerating the resulting image using Nvidia StyleGAN to apply the makeups smoothly.<br><br>
Currently, only lipstick applying is being worked on. Other features (e.g. eyeliners) are coming soon. We do not expect the overall process to change entirely, but some minor details are likely to change.<br><br>
